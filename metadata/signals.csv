This follows a period of varying conditions - from dry spells affecting winter wheat and barley in the east (November 2016) to below-average rainfall impacting the eastern and northwestern regions (December 2016). However, there was a noted improvement in precipitation above average in the northern areas from Hirat to Takhar in February 2017. Despite these fluctuations, the country has not been classified as a hotspot according to the latest ASAP analyses in January 2017 and October 2016, indicating that, while there are areas of concern, the overall situation remains under control but requires monitoring.;"Delayed vegetation growth in the north; precipitation fluctuates; monitoring ongoing.";the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

These dry conditions have now extended to southern provinces like Nimrose, Hilmand, and Kandahar, as well as eastern provinces including Nangarhar, Laghman, and Khost.

The situation began to deteriorate around October 2017, when a rainfall deficit started impacting pastures along the border regions from Turkmenistan to Tajikistan. By January 2018, the dry conditions had begun affecting pastures from Hirat and Badghis in the northeast to Balkh, Kunduz, and Baghlan in the north, also extending to dormant winter wheat in areas like Jawzjan, Faryab, and Badghis.

While the crop conditions were generally good in earlier months due to adequate irrigation, the persistent dry conditions now pose a potential threat to winter cereals, with the full impact still difficult to assess.

Initial signs of concern emerged in January when dry conditions began impacting pastures and winter wheat. By February, the dry conditions had spread, affecting not just the northern and western provinces but also parts of the south and east. Throughout the following months, the situation worsened, with March's below-average biomass levels raising serious concerns about the upcoming winter wheat and barley harvests and water availability for summer irrigation.

As of January 2021, the country is facing significant drought conditions, particularly severe in the southern provinces. Huila, Cunene, and Namibe have experienced substantial rainfall deficits since October, with cumulated amounts ranging from 40-60% below average. This has resulted in dry crop and rangeland conditions, affecting a significant portion (45-60%) of active crop areas with reduced vegetation activity.

The central provincesâBenguela, Huambo, and Bieâalso report severe rainfall deficits from December to mid-January, impacting crop conditions with deficits of about 80%, 60%, and 35% below average, respectively. Prolonged low precipitation could further threaten crop yields.

In summary, while the main cereal season in mid-2020 had a good output, and preparations for the new season began under favorable conditions in late 2020, the current data indicates a critical drought situation that could severely impact agricultural productivity if conditions do not improve soon.";Severe drought threatens crop yields, substantial rainfall deficits reported since October.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/s/c638bda0; https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/s/fcc86ab6; https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/s/7c85cca2";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

Currently, southwestern Angola, especially the provinces of Huila, Cunene, and Namibe, is experiencing significant challenges due to extended large rainfall deficits (30-55% below-average) and above-average temperatures since the start of the season in October. These adverse conditions have resulted in dry crop and rangeland conditions, negatively impacting vegetation activity in a large part of the active areas. Central provinces like Benguela and Huambo have faced less severe conditions, receiving improved rainfall from mid-November to early January, but still experienced below-average rainfall earlier in the season.

The situation is critical as the southwestern region suffered from similar issues in the 2020-2021 agricultural season, leading to significantly reduced agricultural production. Projections indicate a further reduction in cereal production for 2022, attributed to low seed availability and limited economic capacity to access agricultural inputs. This situation exacerbates the already strained food security conditions, with 1.58 million people projected to be in acute food insecurity between October 2021 and March 2022.

As of July 2023, Burkina Faso is experiencing several significant challenges related to crop production and food security:

1. **Crop Development and Rainfall Conditions:**
   - Sowing of sorghum and millet is ongoing and will be finalized by the end of July. Maize is currently in the growing stage and expected to be harvested from August.
   - Cumulative rainfall over the past 90 days has been average to below-average.
   - Some regions, including Est, Centre-est, Centre-ouest, Hauts-bassins, and Cascades, are experiencing water-stressed vegetation, with 30-40% of active crop areas showing greenness anomalies. Wilting of crops is observed due to scarce rains.

2. **Forecasts and Agricultural Impact:**
   - The Copernicus C3S Multimodel forecasts a slight probability for wetter than average conditions in August 2023.
   - Insecurity and increased number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are significantly affecting agricultural activities and access to fields.
   - The cost of agricultural inputs has risen by 50-60%, potentially leading to reduced use of fertilizers and lower yields.

3. **Humanitarian and Food Security Crisis:**
   - An estimated 4.7 million people, over 20% of the population, are in need of humanitarian assistance.
   - Violence and conflict have devastated critical infrastructure and state services.
   - Approximately 800,000 individuals live in 26 blockaded cities with limited or no access to basic necessities, exacerbating the food crisis.

**March 2022**:

Bolivia is currently experiencing mixed and challenging crop conditions due to varying rainfall patterns and water availability. Here's a detailed look at the situation:

1. **Crops and Growth Stages**:
   - Wheat (Andinean), sweet potatoes, potatoes, soybean, barley, and sorghum are in an advanced growth phase.
   - Harvesting of rice and the main season maize is ongoing.

2. **Rainfall and Water Availability**:
   - Rainfall in March was mostly normal to above normal except in the center and south regions, including Chuquisaca, Tarija, and eastern Santa Cruz, which experienced below-normal rainfall.
   - Water conditions for crops are sufficient in most areas, but some regions such as Santa Cruz, Tarija, and Chuquisaca have below-average water availability, negatively impacting crop growth.

3. **Vegetation Status**:
   - There are uneven vegetation conditions:
     - Normal to above-normal vegetation in 64-77% of croplands.
     - Below-average biomass in 12-29% of croplands, particularly in Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca, Tarija, and Beni.
   - Crops such as soybean and sorghum are particularly affected by poor rainfall in the major producing area of Santa Cruz and other parts of Tarija, Chuquisaca, and Potosi.

4. **Forecasts and Potential Implications**:
   - Future rainfall forecasts for the April-May-June period indicate below-normal rainfall across most of Bolivia, which could further exacerbate the drought conditions in already affected areas like Santa Cruz and Potosi.

5. **Natural Disasters and Economic Shocks**:
   - No natural disasters have been identified in March, but unusually high maize prices point to economic stress in several regions.
   - Increasing prices for various crops have been noted, suggesting potential difficulties in food accessibility and affordability.

6. **Food Security**:
   - There is moderately low to low food consumption insufficiency, with around 14% prevalence, amounting to 1.8 million people experiencing food consumption insufficiency.
   - The tendency of this insecurity has been rising over the past three months.

### Context from Previous Months

- **February 2022**: Mixed rainfall with excessive rainfall and pockets of below-normal rainfall affecting crops. Areas like Tarija faced destructive flooding, impacting crops and infrastructure.
  
- **January 2022**: Irregular rainfall distribution with excessive rainfall in December contrasted by dry conditions in January, causing extreme variations impacting crop and vegetation health.
  
- **November 2021**: Severe and prolonged dry conditions at the start of the agricultural campaign, causing early detrimental effects on vegetation.

This evolving scenario indicates that while some regions in Bolivia are experiencing near-normal conditions, significant areas, particularly in Santa Cruz and southern regions, remain under stress due to irregular rainfall and resultant poor water balance, combined with rising food prices and increasing prevalence of food insecurity.";Mixed crop conditions due to irregular rainfall, rising food insecurity.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://climate.copernicus.eu/charts/c3s_seasonal/c3s_seasonal_spatial_mm_rain_3m?facets=Parameters,precipitation&time=2022030100,744,2022040100&type=ensm&area=area13; https://dataviz.vam.wfp.org/economic_explorer/price-forecasts-alerts?adm0=33; https://hungermap.wfp.org/";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

As of February 2023, maize (main season) and sorghum (minor season) are in the vegetation growth stage, and the rice harvest has begun. Earlier rainfall deficits have significantly impacted crop conditions in western and southern departments like La Paz, Oruro, Chuquisaca, Tarija, and Potosi, leading to a 50-70% greenness anomaly in affected areas. However, in Santa Cruz, the countryâs primary grain-producing region, conditions have rebounded to average levels due to above-normal rainfall since mid-December. 

While excessive rainfall in February led to flooding in several departments, including Santa Cruz, the impact on crop surface area has been minor compared to the total active crop areas. This recovery is crucial given the prior ""poor end of season biomass"" warnings and persistent drought in several regions as noted in previous months. Overall, although the situation has improved for some regions, many areas still experience lingering effects of past rainfall deficits.";"Drought-induced deficits impact crops; Santa Cruz recoveries alleviate previous warnings.";the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://h04-tst-asap.jrc.it/asap/assessment/dashboard.php; https://floodlist.com/america/bolivia-floods-la-paz-santa-cruz-february-2023";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

In January 2024, the maize (main cycle) has completed its sowing stage and is entering the vegetation stage. Rice, which went through the vegetation stage in the past two months, is now ready for harvest. Recent rainfall in December and January has been normal to above normal across most of the country, which has been beneficial for maize, expected to show average vegetation conditions. However, about 30% of the total cropland continues to exhibit poor vegetation conditions, particularly affecting rice fields in key producing regions like Beni and Santa Cruz due to significant rainfall deficits experienced during October and November, crucial months for rice sowing.

Despite recent adequate rainfall, the forecast until the end of February predicts drier than normal conditions, which could still negatively impact maize yields. Continuous monitoring of the situation in the coming months will be essential. The pattern of drought and subsequent impact on vegetation from the past months remains a concern, especially for the rice-producing areas.";"Drier conditions predicted, may threaten maize yields; rice fields struggle.";the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/seasonal_forecast.php?sfreg=south_america;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

As of October 2019, Botswana remains heavily impacted by the severe drought conditions that characterized the 2018/19 agricultural season. This period was marked by poor rains, heatwaves, and an extended dry spell, particularly from the end of February to the end of March, which gravely affected both croplands and rangelands.

The country faced significant challenges throughout the last six months:
1. _**April 2019:**_ A late onset of rains led to reduced crop areas and a 50% expected crop failure across planted regions, with major cereal-producing areas experiencing up to a 75% reduction in planted areas. Rangeland conditions were also adversely affected, contributing to livestock fatalities.
2. _**May 2019:**_ The drought's designation persisted, with cumulative rainfall reaching only 50-70% in the eastern croplands and 40-55% in western rangelands. These conditions continued to affect agricultural productivity and livestock health.
3. _**June and July 2019:**_ The drought year declaration was reiterated, with cereal production plummeting 92% compared to the previous year's output, and 90% below the 5-year average. Botswana's dependence on cereal imports is expected to increase significantly.
4. _**August 2019:**_ The agricultural season concluded with expectations of deteriorated food security.
5. _**October 2019:**_ The ongoing drought and the subsequent dry season (April to October/November) have further exerted pressure on livelihoods. Wildlife has been notably affected, with over 100 elephants dying in Chobe National Park due to low water and pasture availability.

Looking forward, planting activities for the next cereal crops are set to begin in November. There is some optimism based on weather predictions indicating a higher probability of average to above-average rainfall for the 2019/20 cropping season, which could potentially lead to a recovery in crop production and improvements in pasture conditions and water availability for livestock.

### Key Points:
- The 2018/19 agricultural season was declared a drought year.
- Significant reduction in cereal production and a rise in import requirements.
- Negative impact on both agriculture and livestock.
- Optimistic weather forecasts for the upcoming season might aid recovery.";Severe drought sharply decreases crops, livestock fatalities rise, wildlife affected.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/s/4c441f5c; http://www.fao.org/giews/countrybrief/country.jsp?code=BWA";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

Over the past six months, there has been a consistent pattern of below-average rainfall leading to large rainfall deficits, particularly in the Chobe, North East, Central, Kweneng, Kgatleng, Southern, and South East provinces. Although there was some improvement in rainfall towards mid-January 2024, it was not sufficient to offset the earlier deficits.

By February, maize and sorghum were just starting their vegetation stage, but 40% of croplands and 20% of rangelands had already experienced poor to very poor rainfall conditions. March continued to see poor rainfall, exacerbating the drought impact. As a result, approximately 50% of the croplands in Chobe and 30%-35% of the rangeland areas in Ghanzi, Ngamiland, and Central are suffering from greenness anomalies, indicative of poor vegetation health.

Although it was not classified as a hotspot country in previous months and generally experienced near-average rainfall, localized flooding occurred in June and July due to particularly abundant rainfall. This has shifted to a rainfall deficit in August and September, causing delays in the planting of the second-season Maize crop in the central and southern regions. The earlier part of the year showed slightly below-average crop conditions in the North Eastern region, but the reasons for this were unclear.

Over the past months, Cuba has dealt with various adverse climatic conditions, economic constraints, and social unrest, which have culminated in a complex situation.

### Agricultural Conditions:
1. **Rainfall and Water Availability**: Rainfall has been highly variable, with periods of below-normal precipitation in several key agricultural areas, followed by extreme rainfall events and a hurricane. While some months saw sufficient to above-average rainfall, others experienced deficits, particularly in central and western provinces. The extreme event in September, Hurricane Ian, delivered torrential rains that compensated for prior deficits in some areas but caused substantial flooding and damage in others.
2. **Temperature and Radiation**: Conditions have generally been average, with minor deviations.
3. **Vegetation Status**: Vegetation health has fluctuated, with most cropland presenting normal to above-normal conditions but specific areas experiencing below-average vegetation due to the inconsistent rainfall.
4. **Impact of Hurricane Ian**: Hurricane Ian caused severe destruction, especially in Pinar del RÃ­o, affecting housing, electricity, water supply, and significant agricultural infrastructure, including the critical tobacco sector. The damage is expected to severely impact crop production, particularly rice and beans, which are essential staples.

### Economic and Social Context:
1. **Economic Constraints**: The ongoing economic crisis, exacerbated by events such as the Ukraine-Russia conflict, has led to currency depreciation, high international prices, and difficulties accessing agricultural inputs. This situation has resulted in lower agricultural productivity and higher food prices, further straining food security.
2. **Social Instability**: The compounded issues of food shortages, prolonged power outages, and general economic hardship have led to social unrest and protests.

### Food Security:
Food security remains precarious with a significant portion of the population (approx. one-third) facing food insufficiency. The natural disaster's impact on agriculture, coupled with pre-existing economic and infrastructural challenges, has jeopardized the food supply and access. The latest disruptions from Hurricane Ian have compounded these issues, leaving many without electricity or access to potable water, further aggravating the already fragile food security situation.

In summary, Cuba is experiencing a confluence of detrimental factors impacting its agricultural productivity and food security. The recent hurricane has only exacerbated an already challenging scenario marked by economic difficulties, social unrest, and fluctuating climatic conditions. This situation calls for urgent attention to mitigate the adverse impacts on the population's food security and overall well-being.";Hurricane, economic crises devastate agriculture, worsening food security and social unrest.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://climate.copernicus.eu/charts/c3s_seasonal/c3s_seasonal_spatial_mm_rain_3m?facets=Parameters,precipitation&time=2022090100,720,2022100100&type=ensm&area=area13; https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2022-000320-cub; https://reliefweb.int/report/cuba/respuesta-huracan-ian-reporte-de-situacion-no-06-de-la-oficina-de-la-coordinadora-residente-2-de-octubre-de-2022; https://reliefweb.int/report/cuba/hurricane-ian-response-resident-coordinators-office-situation-report-no-04-29-september-2022; https://reliefweb.int/report/cuba/latinoamerica-el-caribe-resumen-de-situacion-semanal-26-de-septiembre-2022-2-de-octubre-2022-al-3-de-octubre-2022; https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/protests-cuba-erupt-days-power-hurricane-ian-rcna50214; https://babalublog.com/2022/09/24/reports-from-cuba-rice-and-bean-production-collapses-in-cuba-while-hotel-rooms-grow-by-125/; https://reliefweb.int/report/cuba/latinoamerica-el-caribe-resumen-de-situacion-semanal-26-de-septiembre-2022-2-de-octubre-2022-al-3-de-octubre-2022";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

Towards the end of the Meher season, Ethiopia is experiencing generally close to average harvest production expectations. However, the country faces significant challenges due to localized production shortfalls primarily caused by floods and an ongoing desert locust outbreak in the Afar and Tigray states. 

### Contextual Overview

- **July 2019:** The season began with well-distributed rainfall, leading to good crop conditions across most of the country, except for some deficits in Tigray and parts of Amhara. Pastoral vegetation conditions were also favorable.
- **August 2019:** The Meher season progressed well with normal rainfall, though the northern regions, particularly Tigray and North Gonder, experienced a rainfall deficit.
- **September 2019:** Most parts continued to receive appropriate rainfall, benefiting crops and pastoral areas, but eastern Tigray and northern Afar started showing signs of abnormal water stress.
- **October 2019:** Favorable conditions for crop growth persisted, but excessive rainfall led to flooding, impacting half a million people, especially in the Somali region.
- **November 2019:** Close to average and well-distributed rainfall generally benefited the crops, but desert locusts began causing significant damage, particularly in Afar, Amhara, Oromia, Somali, and Tigray regions. Postharvest losses were a concern due to high moisture content.
- **January 2020:** Although above-average rainfall over the last three months of 2019 supported crop growth and pasture regeneration, the desert locust outbreak remains a critical threat, particularly as the country faces high inflation and food prices due to multiple climate shocks and political tensions.

The ongoing desert locust outbreak poses a serious risk to future crop production and food security, especially for the coming 2020 Belg season.";Desert locust outbreak, floods threaten harvests and food security outlook.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;http://www.fao.org/emergencies/en/;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

**Current Situation:**
Ethiopia has been experiencing above-average rainfall in September. This has led to high levels of greenness across most of the country, which is generally beneficial for Meher season crops. However, floods continue to damage infrastructure and displace populations across several regions, including Afar and East Shewa, negatively affecting agricultural areas.

**Context from Previous Months:**
1. **April 2020:** Ethiopia experienced a timely onset of the Belg season rainfall but was majorly affected by a desert locust invasion causing significant crop and pasture losses, impacting about 1 million people. COVID-19 containment measures also hindered locust control efforts.

2. **May 2020:** Heavy rainfall in April and early May led to floods in many regions, causing displacement and localized crop losses. Despite this, ample rainfall was expected to benefit Belg season crops. Nevertheless, the locust invasion continued, compounded by the impact of COVID-19 containment measures.

3. **June 2020:** The Belg season ended with below-average production owing to floods, locust invasions, and COVID-19 impacts. Active COVID-19 cases surged, aggravating the situation. The Meher season began under favorable agro-climatic conditions, but desert locusts remained a significant threat.

4. **July 2020:** Desert locusts continued to threaten agriculture, and COVID-19 led to labor shortages and potentially below-average Meher planting areas. Despite positive agro-climatic conditions, overall production was forecast to be below average due to prior disruptions.

5. **August 2020:** Although abundant rainfall in July-August favored Meher crops, localized flooding and continued locust threat posed challenges. Humanitarian needs rose due to prolonged COVID-19 measures and subpar Belg production.

**Challenges Ahead:**
- Ongoing flooding impacts, especially in regions like Afar and East Shewa.
- Persistent desert locust swarms, expected to have a greater impact than in neighboring countries.
- Decreased availability of agricultural inputs and labor shortages due to COVID-19 measures.

Overall, while rainfall conditions have been favorable for crop greenness, multiple adversities, including floods, locust invasions, and COVID-19-induced challenges, continue to impede agricultural productivity and elevate humanitarian assistance needs.";Floods, locust invasions, COVID-19 measures disrupt favorable crop conditions.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"http://floodlist.com/africa/ethiopia-floods-update-september-2020; https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/s/fd98ca80; https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/s/7274d2f8; https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/files/special_focus_2020_09.pdf; https://fews.net/east-africa/ethiopia/key-message-update/september-2020";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

Ethiopia is currently facing severe drought conditions, marking the fourth consecutive season of below-average rainfall, particularly affecting the southern and eastern regions. The recent MAM (March-May) rainfall was the lowest recorded in 70 years, leading to widespread planting delays or failures in Belg crop areas across Oromia and SNNPR. Pasture conditions in central, eastern, and southern Ethiopia are extremely poor, with few alternatives for migration, resulting in deteriorating animal body conditions and significant declines in livestock and milk production. The conflict in the Tigray region and its spread to Amhara and Afar regions has further complicated the agricultural scenario, limiting access to seeds, fertilizers, and humanitarian aid. Rising prices for essential non-food items, such as fertilizer, exacerbated by the crisis in Ukraine, are piling additional pressure on the agricultural sector. Over 30 million people require humanitarian assistance, with 15 million in critical conditions forecasted for July-September 2022 due to ongoing conflicts, drought, the pandemic, and economic challenges, leading to high food prices and severe food security concerns across the country.

Early in the year, rainfall was well-distributed and abundant, supporting Belg crop production and the planting of Meher crops. However, recent months have seen mixed rainfall distribution with deficits up to 30% in regions like Afar, Tigray, and the Rift Valley, alongside above-average temperatures. These conditions pose risks to Meher crop growth, with the forecast for September predicting below-average rainfall.

Additionally, flooding in March and April affected many areas, while ongoing conflict, particularly heavy fighting recently spreading across Amhara, increases the risk of a new civil war, severely impacting food security and humanitarian efforts. Currently, between 19 and 20 million people need humanitarian food assistance, exacerbated by a cholera outbreak with 15,685 reported cases and 189 deaths.

As of November 2020, Guatemala is facing significant challenges due to heavy rains and strong winds brought by Hurricane ETA and Tropical Storm Iota. These events have caused substantial flooding, fatalities, landslides, and crop damage across numerous municipalities, severely impacting postrera bean production, especially in regions like Jutiapa, Chiquimula, Santa Rosa, Alta Verapaz, and others. 

Contextualizing this, the earlier part of the year saw generally favorable agro-climatic conditions for crop development and harvesting. Sowing and development of the primera season crops benefited from timely and above-average rains, despite some flooding from tropical storms Amanda and Cristobal in May-June. The primera season harvest was completed successfully, with above-average production anticipated due to beneficial weather conditions. Postrera planting also began well with adequate soil moisture.

However, the recent catastrophic weather events have disrupted this positive trajectory, resulting in extensive crop damage and posing a serious threat to food security in the affected regions.";Hurricane, tropical storm devastate crops, threaten food security after good start.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://www.maga.gob.gt/download/info-2320.pdf; https://www.maga.gob.gt/download/info-2420.pdf";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

#### Agricultural Conditions:
- **Crops**: The primary crop harvest (maize, beans, sorghum) is ongoing and expected to conclude by November. Secondary season crops are in the growth stage. Despite initial optimism for an above-average Primera production, this outlook has been affected by hurricanes causing crop damage.
- **Rainfall**: Below-average rainfall was prevalent in October, particularly in the Central, Southern, and Western regions. 
- **SPI1**: 69% of cropland had normal rainfall; 31% experienced below-average rainfall, affecting the Western, Southern, Quiche, Huehuetenango, and Central regions.
- **Vegetation and Water**: Cropland vegetation is mostly normal, with an improvement in some areas due to the favorable conditions earlier in the Primera season. Water availability remained adequate despite some localized shortfalls.

#### Weather and Natural Disasters:
- **Hurricanes**: October was marked by significant hurricane activity, including Hurricanes Julia and Fiona, causing widespread infrastructure damage and severely affecting agricultural operations.
- **Rainfall Forecast**: Predictions indicate normal to slightly below-normal rainfall for the upcoming months, potentially influencing the growth of second-cycle crops.

#### Economic and Food Security:
- **Input Prices**: Persistent high prices for agricultural inputs, particularly fertilizers, continue to constrain production.
- **Food Prices**: Inflation remains a significant issue, with food prices notably high, impacting household purchasing power despite ongoing harvests. The national year-on-year inflation rate was 8.9% as of August, with food prices surging by 13.3%.
- **Food Security**: Approximately 3.2 million people are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or above, a significant increase from the previous year. The hurricane impacts are likely to exacerbate this situation, particularly affecting maize harvests and transportation infrastructure.

Overall, the situation in October reflects a complex interplay of favorable initial conditions for agriculture heavily disrupted by natural disasters, alongside persistent economic challenges that continue to impact food security across the country.";Hurricanes hamper harvests, inflation spikes, 3.2 million face food insecurity.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://climate.copernicus.eu/charts/c3s_seasonal/c3s_seasonal_spatial_mm_rain_3m?facets=Parameters,precipitation&time=2022100100,744,2022110100&type=ensm&area=area13; https://floodlist.com/america/central-america-hurricane-julia-october-2022; https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2022-000357-blz; https://floodlist.com/america/floods-el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-nicaragua-september-2022; https://latinarepublic.com/2022/10/13/hurricane-julia-hits-central-american-countries-as-tropical-storm/; https://fews.net/central-america-and-caribbean/guatemala; https://www.fao.org/giews/countrybrief/country.jsp?code=GTM; https://latinarepublic.com/2022/10/13/hurricane-julia-hits-central-american-countries-as-tropical-storm/; https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1155665/?iso3=GTM";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

The harvest of the **Primera season** has concluded in Honduras, and the situation is highly unfavorable due to significant rainfall deficits throughout the season. The latest data indicates a severe decline in maize production, estimated to be down by 50%. The most severely affected areas include subsistence farms in the Francisco Morazan Department, with 89% of maize losses, and major commercial areas in El Paraiso (67.9%) and Olancho (70.43%). For beans, which are less crucial than maize, there was a reported loss of 10.3%.

This marks the second consecutive year of below-average yields for the Primera season. The main issues traced back to July and August, where dry conditions and below-average rainfall particularly deteriorated the vegetation status in key regions like the Fonseca Gulf Area (Valle, Choluteca, and Paraiso regions) and continued into September. The **Postrera planting**, which comes after Primera, is also delayed due to poor rainfall.

In response to these challenging conditions, the government is recommending a focus on bean production to capitalize on the beneficial rainfall forecasted for the upcoming weeks.";Severe rainfall deficits lead to drastic maize loss, suggesting crop focus shift.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQVQTGEUS44&t=716s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQVQTGEUS44&t=716s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQVQTGEUS44&t=716s";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

**November 2020:**
Honduras has recently experienced significant challenges due to natural disasters. Early November brought torrential rains from Hurricane Eta, followed by additional heavy rains, which led to widespread landslides and flooding across the country. The excessive rainfall, ranging from 100 to 250% above average over the past 30 days, has severely impacted agriculture, damaging around 260,000 hectares. Specific crop losses include the destruction of 14,800 hectares of beans and 8,700 hectares of maize.

To mitigate these losses and support farmers, the government is distributing vouchers and seeds as part of the ""Bono de Solidaridad Productiva"" initiative. The most affected regions by flooding include AtlÃ¡ntida, Choluteca, ColÃ³n, Comayagua, CopÃ¡n, El ParaÃ­so, Francisco MorazÃ¡n, Gracias a Dios, IntibucÃ¡, Lempira, Ocotepeque, Olancho, Santa BÃ¡rbara, Valle, and Yoro.

**Contextual Background:**
Earlier in the year, the planting of the *primera* season crops, primarily maize and beans, benefitted from the improving rainfall starting from May 2020, despite initial deficits. Tropical Storms Amanda and Cristobal caused some flooding in June, particularly affecting southern and western parts of Honduras. Despite this, the overall conditions for *primera* crops were favorable, resulting in above-average yields by September, with maize and beans both seeing better-than-average production.

Before the recent flooding, the harvest for the *primera* season was completed successfully, and the *postrera* season was ongoing with good prospects, supported by sufficient soil moisture and favorable weather conditions. The agricultural production for basic grains was estimated at 16.8 million quintals. The overall situation was not deemed critical by the October ASAP analysis.

**Summary:**
In summary, while Honduras managed a favorable *primera* season and the outlook for the *postrera* season was initially positive, the recent impact of Hurricane Eta and subsequent rains has significantly disrupted agricultural activities, leading to substantial crop damage and losses. The government has initiated measures to assist affected farmers and promote recovery.";Hurricane Eta devastates agriculture, damages 260,000 hectares, government aid begins.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://priv-bx-myremote.tech.ec.europa.eu/v3/__https:/www.radiohrn.hn/,DanaInfo=.ausngikku0nJn0z,SSL+iota-y-eta-destruyen-115000-manzanas-de-cultivos-y-echan-a-perder-un-millon-de-litros-de-leche__;!!DOxrgLBm!Xt8uJsur6eWCJ3BZrl0CAeoNDsEjOSmtV2FMmPB0M8j8tXZYxw68EaQYRiaHg304sjMtHX8Xjw$; https://priv-bx-myremote.tech.ec.europa.eu/v3/__https:/sag.gob.hn/sala-de-prensa/noticias/ano-2/noviembre-2020/conferencia-de-prensa-cifr/,DanaInfo=.ausngikku0nJn0z,SSL+__;!!DOxrgLBm!Xt8uJsur6eWCJ3BZrl0CAeoNDsEjOSmtV2FMmPB0M8j8tXZYxw68EaQYRiaHg304sjO_QJKD2Q$; https://priv-bx-myremote.tech.ec.europa.eu/v3/__https:/sag.gob.hn/sala-de-prensa/noticias/ano-2/noviembre-2020/conferencia-de-prensa-cifr/,DanaInfo=.ausngikku0nJn0z,SSL+__;!!DOxrgLBm!Xt8uJsur6eWCJ3BZrl0CAeoNDsEjOSmtV2FMmPB0M8j8tXZYxw68EaQYRiaHg304sjO_QJKD2Q$";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

The second rain season has just ended with mixed results. Rainfall deficits have notably affected eastern and northern areas, impacting several crops. Notably, Santa Barbara, Copan, AtlÃ¡ntida, IntibucÃ¡, Cortes, Lempira, Ocotepeque, Yoro, and Francisco MorazÃ¡n have seen extensive cropland affected. Periodic better-than-average rainfall in December has not been sufficient to completely offset these deficits, leading to continued stress on water supplies for up to 29% of croplands.

Temperature conditions have been overall normal but slightly higher than average in some regions during parts of December and January. This can affect crop development, especially when combined with below-average rainfall. Although vegetation indices indicate mostly normal conditions, areas in the east, north, and central parts of the country are showing stress, with around 14% of cropland nationally being affected.

The food security situation remains critical. From December 2021 to March 2022, approximately 2.2 million people are expected to be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or higher. The drivers of this crisis include low production from the Primera season harvest, dry conditions affecting the Postrera season, socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19, and high prices for food, inputs, and fuel. Additionally, past disasters and insufficient humanitarian assistance exacerbate the situation. Consequently, subsistence farmers, who lost up to half of their harvest in some regions, are expected to face severe challenges in food security and agricultural productivity.";Rain deficits and high costs drive food crisis, impacting 2.2 million.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1155409/?iso3=HND; https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1155409/?iso3=HND; https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_Trinational_Acute_Food_Insec_2021Nov2022Aug_Report_Spanish.pdf";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

The harvest of the main season crops is still ongoing and expected to finish in early November, with near-average cereal harvests projected due to generally favorable weather conditions earlier in the season. However, October experienced below-average rainfall, with excessive rainfall during certain periods causing detrimental flooding that hampered ongoing harvests.

The situation was exacerbated by two hurricanes in OctoberâJulia and Lisaâwhich caused flash floods, landslides, and extensive damage to infrastructure and agriculture. Notably, nearly 331,000 tons of maize were lost, and more than 100,000 people were affected by the severe weather events. This added to the strain already exerted by the persistent high inflation rates, with food prices significantly higher compared to previous years, limiting households' purchasing power and access to food.

In June 2022, Haiti faced challenging agricultural conditions, with the continuation of dry spells and reduced rainfall impacting crop growth. Despite normal rainfall periods in the second and third dekads, the early part of June experienced below-normal rainfall, leading to a Level 1 drought warning in many areas. Consequently, the early conditions of crop growth were unfavorable, particularly causing delays in sorghum planting.

**Rainfall and Water Supply:** 
- In June, normal rainfall was recorded for most croplands (93%), with some regions such as Sud (12%) and Grande Anse (37%) receiving below-normal rainfall.
- Water supply metrics show that the majority of croplands (65-69%) had sufficient water, but 11% still faced water shortages.

**Vegetation and Crop Conditions:** 
- Vegetation status revealed 66% of croplands in normal condition, and 30% above normal. However, the overall vegetation condition declined compared to previous months due to early dry periods.
- The diminishing vegetation status indicates less-than-optimal conditions for main season crops and potential impacts on crop yields.

**Temperature and Other Environmental Factors:**
- Temperatures were normal (22-26Â°C) and aligned with seasonal trends.
- No significant natural disasters were reported.

**Economic and Food Security Challenges:**
- Economic shocks remain profound, with high food prices, including anticipated rises in rice, vegetable oil, and wheat flour due to currency depreciation and global commodity prices.
- Despite some improvement due to the ongoing harvest, urban households continue to struggle with food access and purchasing power reduction due to inflation.

### Contextual Insights:
**Previous Months' Impact:**
- January to May saw mixed agro-climatic conditions with sporadic dry periods and flash floods affecting various regions, contributing to the lingering poor vegetation status in June.
- Chronic economic instability and socio-political unrest have exacerbated food insecurity, impacting households' access to necessary agricultural inputs and stable markets. 

**Forecast and Future Outlook:**
- The forecast for the July-September (JAS) period suggests slightly above-normal rainfall, which could potentially mitigate some of the drought impacts.
- Food security remains a significant concern with a reported 46% of the population in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or worse, though some areas may see slight improvements due to recent harvests.

### Conclusion:
June 2022 was marked by persistent and severe drought conditions impacting crop growth in Haiti, compounded by economic challenges and high food prices. Despite some rainfall and potential improvement in upcoming months, the overall food security outlook remains precarious, with many households particularly in urban areas struggling to meet their food needs.";Persistent drought hampers crop growth, exacerbating food insecurity amidst economic issues.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://climate.copernicus.eu/charts/c3s_seasonal/c3s_seasonal_spatial_mm_rain_3m?facets=Parameters,precipitation&time=2022060100,720,2022070100&type=ensm&area=area13; https://fews.net/global/price-watch/june-2022; https://fews.net/central-america-and-caribbean; https://fews.net/central-america-and-caribbean";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

However, the centre and south of the country continue to experience drier than average conditions, with noticeable impacts on crops, especially in the southern provinces of Fars and Kerman.

Looking back, the country experienced consistently drier than average conditions since mid-2017, mainly affecting central northern regions like Ghazvin and Tehran, but with no significant impact on irrigated summer crops initially. Despite a dry autumn that saw less than normal rainfall affecting the north-western, central northern regions and western areas bordering Iraq, winter cereal crops remained in normal condition, with slight recovery in rainfall noted by January 2018. 

Nonetheless, the prolonged dryness has now culminated in evident stress on crops in central and southern regions, marking a significant shift from earlier resilience owing largely to the lack of sufficient precipitation in these areas.

This issue, which has persisted for a decade, has led to government bans on 13 crops this year and resulted in farmers' protests. Conversely, in the western and north-western regions, the harvest of cereals has concluded and is expected to be above average. This positive outcome follows a trend observed since February, where good rainfall and beneficial temperatures supported cereal growth in these areas.

The Kurdistan region (including Dahuk, Erbil, Ninewa, and Sulaymaniyah) initially faced a delayed start to the cereal growing season, which later stabilized, resulting in favorable production prospects by mid-2017. By July, the harvest for wheat concluded with production anticipated to be close to average despite earlier delays. The country was not marked as a hotspot for adverse agricultural conditions in August and September.

In October, although the Anbar region faced challenges with below-average irrigated crop production due to ongoing conflict, no significant weather-related concerns were reported elsewhere. The onset of the rainy season in late October was expected to prompt the sowing of barley in northern and eastern regions.

However, by November 2017, the situation indicates some emerging concerns: In Sulaymaniyah and potentially other northeast areas, the growth of winter cereals (barley and wheat) is delayed compared to the long-term averages. This delay correlates with significantly lower rainfall (only 39 mm received compared to the average of 76 mm) and possibly a shift towards spring cereals. Similarly, Anbar also experiences delays in the start of the season for irrigated winter cereals, continuing the trend seen in previous years due to conflict.

Thus, while immediate crisis conditions are not apparent, the delayed onset of winter cereal growth due to deficient rainfall and ongoing conflict in Anbar warrant close monitoring.";Delayed winter cereal growth due to deficient rainfall, conflict impacts farming.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

As of August 2018, Iraq is experiencing notable challenges in its agricultural sector, primarily due to severe irrigation water shortages. The situation has led to a significant reduction in the irrigated crop areas, especially affecting the southern province of Najaf. In response, the government has implemented a ban on the cultivation of high water-intensive summer crops such as rice to manage the limited water resources efficiently. This decision has drastically reduced the area allocated for rice cultivation to less than three percent of the previous yearâs allocation.

**Contextualization:**

Throughout the past six months, northern Iraq has faced persistent issues with crop biomass and cereal production due to failed sowings and dry spells, significantly below pre-conflict and 2017 levels. April and May reports highlighted particularly poor cereal production in the regions north of Mosul and Dahuk. By June, this trend was confirmed, emphasizing a strong drop in production.

In the south, although initially favorable conditions for cereals development were reported, by July, water shortages began affecting irrigated summer crops. This resulted in the reduction of these crops' areas, and with reservoirs like the Mosul dam lake shrinking, the government had to take stringent measures. 

In essence, while Iraq is not currently designated as a hotspot country, the imposed restrictions and significant reductions in crop areas illustrate the acute impact of continued water scarcity on its agriculture.";Severe water shortages force drastic cutbacks in irrigated crop areas.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iraq-bans-farming-summer-crops-water-shortage-turkey-1.4734611;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

Crop biomass is substantially below average in these regions, exacerbated by a government decision to halve irrigated farmland to conserve reservoir water for urban needs.

Historical data reveals that conditions started to deteriorate in September 2021, where lower water levels in reservoirs already impacted minor rice production areas like Diyala and Missan. Although biomass levels were close to average in January despite small rainfall deficits, by February, biomass levels declined, pointing towards a below-average production.

The problem is further compounded by significantly reduced reservoir sizes, essential for irrigation, which have shrunk notably between 2019 and 2022 and continued to dwindle from March 2021 to March 2022.

In July 2021, the country is experiencing below-average biomass for both spring cereals and winter crops across its major agricultural regions. 

**Northern Main Producing Area (Severo, Kustanayskaya, Akmolinskaya):**
- **Biomass**: Spring cereals have below-average biomass.
- **Rainfall**: There has been a significant rainfall deficit of 50-70% from mid March to early July.
- **Previous Context**: Initially delayed start in the growth season due to persistent snow till mid April, and despite some initial catch-up, inadequate rainfall and higher temperatures in May slowed growth.

**Southern Part of the Country (Yujno K. to Almatinskaya):**
- **Biomass**: Vegetation biomass remains below average.
- **Rainfall**: Rainfall deficit of 50% since mid April.
- **Temperature**: A sharp 9C temperature drop from mid to end February likely influenced the initial growth phases adversely.
- **Previous Context**: Despite abundant rainfall in March, growth was already sluggish starting from mid March. Since mid April, dry conditions have exacerbated the situation, particularly impacting rainfed crops and pastures, while irrigated crops fared comparatively better.

As of November 2018, Kenya is experiencing irregular and below-average short rains in several regions, including center-east, north-western pastoral areas, and southern-inland agricultural zones. This has led to reduced pastoral biomass in various counties such as Kitui, Isiolo, Laikipia, Samburu, Turkana, Meru, and Garissa, and might negatively affect crops in marginal areas like Kitui, Tana River, and parts of the Rift Valley.

Historically, the country has seen a sequence of weather extremes over the past six months:
- **May-June 2018:** Record rainfall led to flooding, displacement of nearly 300,000 people, and significant damage to crops, irrigation infrastructure, and livestock. The flooding also increased the risk of pests, diseases, and outbreaks of cholera and Rift Valley fever.
- **July-August 2018:** The abundant rainfall improved vegetation productivity and pastoral conditions, aiding cereal availability. Some flood-affected areas and Rift Valley fever outbreaks still struggled.
- **September 2018:** Conditions returned to a more stable state, no significant issues noted.
- **October 2018:** Short rains began on time but heavy localized flooding occurred in coastal areas.

Currently, the below-average short rains are a concern, impacting both pastoral and agricultural areas negatively, reversing some of the recovery seen earlier in the year.";Below-average short rains threaten crops, pastoral biomass in multiple regions.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

The country experienced exceptionally abundant rainfall from late 2019 to early 2020, leading to above-average greenness of natural vegetation and favorable conditions for pastoral growth. Despite the benefits for crops and rangelands, the excessive moisture has facilitated a rapid increase in Desert Locusts, which invaded Kenya from Somalia and Ethiopia in December 2019. These locusts pose a significant threat to crops, with the potential to cause extensive crop failure if the favorable breeding conditions persist throughout the long rains season.

Leading up to this period, Kenya faced a series of climatic challenges:

- **August 2019:** There was late seasonal rainfall which slightly improved crop conditions in western and central Kenya but overall expected crop production was 25% below the five-year average. The eastern and coastal counties faced near-total crop failure, and the north-east experienced critical conditions for livestock due to prolonged drought.
- **September 2019:** Improved crop conditions in western Kenya and Rift Valley occurred just before harvest, albeit still 10% below the five-year average. Eastern Kenya continued to suffer from failed long rains and resultant high food prices. Monitoring was advised for improved pasture conditions following optimistic short rains forecasts.
- **October 2019:** Above-average rainfall in most parts of Kenya brought some relief to drought-affected pastoral areas but also led to floods in the north and east regions, disrupting late-planted crops in the Rift Valley.
- **November 2019:** Heavy rains led to landslides, floods, and widespread infrastructure damage. While these rains were beneficial for most crops and rangelands, flooded areas and delayed crop harvesting in the Rift Valley were adversely affected.
- **January 2020:** Rains continued till December end, further benefiting rangelands and crops but also triggering an exceptional desert locust outbreak, originating mainly from the Red Sea coast, Ethiopia, and Somalia.

In summary, while the recent rains have improved pasture and moisture conditions, the desert locusts remain a grave concern, potentially undermining agricultural recovery across Kenya in 2020.";Excess rains enhanced vegetation but led to severe Desert Locust outbreak.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;https://mcusercontent.com/c0c3fc97a16d77359aa6419af/files/ec8ce2a1-1089-4f20-9947-6a761d26ab0b/FSNWG_Special_Report___Desert_Locust_Impacts___17_Feb_2020.pdf;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

As of November 2021, the drought situation in central, eastern, and coastal Kenya is worsening. Mid-way through the short rains season, these regions have only received 30-40% of the average rainfall. This marks the third consecutive drought-affected season for these areas, leading to scarce pasture and drinking water for livestock as reported by the NDMA. 

In contrast, western Kenya experienced timely short rains, but these have also been significantly below average in the past 40 days.

**Context:**
- May 2021: Western and central Kenya had above-average rainfall leading to flooding, while eastern and coastal regions experienced significant deficits affecting crop production.
- June 2021 to August 2021: Eastern, northern, and coastal areas continued to suffer below-average rainfall and pasture conditions, causing crop failures and heightened food insecurity.
- September 2021: Deterioration of pastoral vegetation due to high temperatures and dry conditions. Reports indicated that around 2.1 million people are highly food insecure, with acute malnutrition affecting over 650,000 children and 96,000 pregnant/lactating women.
- October 2021: Delays in the short rains and poor seasonal rainfall forecast exacerbated drought conditions following previously failed rainy seasons.

Overall, a combination of climatic and socioeconomic factors, including poor rains, low agricultural production, and high food prices, has escalated food insecurity risks, particularly in the eastern and coastal regions of Kenya.";"Worsening drought in central, eastern, coastal regions; critical water scarcity affects livestock.";the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;https://www.ndma.go.ke/;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

As of June 2022, drought conditions in Kenya have significantly deteriorated, driven by the poor performance of the 2021 short rains, preceding failed consecutive seasons, an early cessation of the 2022 long rains, and high temperatures across central, eastern, and coastal areas. The appalling vegetation conditions have been reported via satellite imagery, notably in Laikipia, Meru, Samburu, and several Southern Coastal and Inland areas. Pastoral regions, especially in the eastern part, are suffering from severe vegetation depletion, leading to livestock deaths and extending the distances populations must trek for access to drinking water.

The compromised pastoral conditions continue to push many households toward a rapid depletion of coping strategies amidst escalating food and fuel prices, attributed to the economic situation. The situation has exacerbated food insecurity, with the number of people requiring food assistance surging from 3.5 million in May to 4.1 million in June, including 1.1 million in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) and 3 million in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis).

**Contextual Background:**

In the preceding months, January through May 2022, Kenya faced persistent drought stress primarily affecting the northern, eastern, and coastal parts while the major crop-producing regions in the west and Rift Valley experienced normal conditions. Despite some late-season rainfall and improvements, key issues such as declining pasture, water resources, and consequent negative impacts on livestock conditions and milk production have been repeatedly highlighted. Added to this, staple food prices have been constantly rising, increasing the risk of food insecurity, particularly in the eastern and central drylands and southern and coastal marginal agricultural areas. Reports have projected worsening food insecurity exacerbated by consecutive drought seasons, evident by reduced crop production and heightened malnutrition rates.";Drought intensifies, worsening food insecurity as pastoral areas deplete rapidly.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

This has led to widespread flooding in various counties including Mandera, Marsabit, Meru, Samburu, Isiolo, Turkana, Busia, and parts of Mombasa. The floods have resulted in loss of human lives, extensive damage to livestock, and infrastructure. Despite good long rains season crop production expectations in the unimodal parts of north rift and Western Kenya, the exceptional rainfall poses a risk of postharvest losses. In the southeast and coastal marginal areas of the ASALs, crop production has improved from the previous season due to favorable rains and government-subsidized fertilizer, except in a few counties like Kajiado and Taita Taveta. 

The short rains season started late in the bimodal areas of central and eastern Kenya, with above-average rainfall predicted for December to January. Pastoral areas in the North/West are struggling with poor vegetation conditions due to high temperatures since June. Food security is expected to improve with the onset of short rains, with 1.5 million people currently classified in IPC Phase 3 or above (Crisis or worse).

Currently, the country is experiencing significant negative impacts on winter crops, especially in the northern regions of Chuy and Talas. Winter crop growth has notably slowed since late February to early March, transitioning from above-average to below-average biomass. This drop is attributed to a combination of sudden temperature changes, with a sharp temperature drop in the third dekad of February, followed by below-average rainfall in April and May. Consequently, winter crops production is expected to be below average in these provinces due to these stressing environmental conditions. 

Contextually, while the country had not been a hotspot in previous months, March observed average negative temperatures and persistent snow, which likely contributed to the suboptimal conditions affecting winter crops. By May, it was noted that winter crop biomass was already below average, and more bare soil fields were observed, indicating possible shifts by farmers to spring or summer crops, possibly due to earlier winter cereals failures. The ongoing drought conditions continue to negatively impact agricultural productivity in the region.";"Severe drought impacting winter crops; below-average production expected in north.";the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

As of July 2022, the biomass of second (Yala) rice and maize crops in Sri Lanka, which were sown from April to May for harvest in August, remains close to or above average across all provinces. This resilience is noted despite a significant drop in rainfall (ranging from -35% in the Southern region to -60% in the North West) and a critical shortage of essential agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, seeds, and fuel.

The country is grappling with the most severe economic crisis since its independence, leading to acute food insecurity, with estimates suggesting that 3 in 10 households are food insecure. Reduced availability of inputs has caused farmers to abandon fields, with production expected to drop by up to 50%. This dire economic situation originates from a combination of external factors (like the decline in remittances and tourism due to COVID-19) and internal mismanagement (such as increased debt and tax reductions).

To contextualize, conditions leading to this crisis have been developing over the past months. The initiation of sowing in April was affected by ongoing economic struggles which hampered access to essential farming inputs. Despite these challenges, initial crop growth was supported by favorable rainfall. However, by June, although rainfall remained beneficial, the stress of economic constraints became more pronounced. As a result, while the biomass remains relatively stable, overall agricultural productivity has been severely compromised.";"Yala crops defy drought and input shortages; economic crisis drives food insecurity.";the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-17/sri-lanka-faces-food-crisis-as-farmers-abandon-fields-and-inflation-surges; https://reliefweb.int/report/sri-lanka/wfp-sri-lanka-situation-report-6-july-2022";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

As of November 2021, Madagascarâs rainy season has begun, though with only 40 to 50% of the average rainfall for October to early November. This has delayed the growth of rice and maize crops across various regions, from the central highlands to the southern arid areas. The food situation remains particularly dire in southern Madagascar (Androy, Anosy, and Atsimo Andrefana), where recurrent droughts over the past three years have resulted in severe food insecurity, with around 1.3 million people in acute need. Sandstorms have further damaged early crops in these areas.

The upcoming months are forecasted to receive close to or above-average rainfall, which should aid crop growth and offer some relief, provided adequate distribution of seeds and staple foods to affected farmers. This improved rainfall may be crucial given the substantial soil moisture deficits and poor harvests of recent seasons.

Madagascar is currently in the off-season for crop production, with rice planting in the center-north scheduled to begin in November. The food security situation remains concerning, particularly in the Grand South regions of Anosy, Atsimo Andrefana, and Androy. Households in these regions are now relying on recently harvested cassava and sweet potato. However, due to below-average production and rising food prices, crisis to emergency food security outcomes (IPC phases 3 and 4) are expected to emerge starting from December, coinciding with the lean season.

### Context of the Recent Past

1. **March 2022**: Summer crop growth faced delays due to a significant rainfall deficit from October to mid-December. Subsequent storms in January brought beneficial rainfall, but biomass levels remained below average. Food assistance was required for 1.5 to 2 million people in the drought-affected southern regions.

2. **April 2022**: Improved conditions in the northern regions due to January-March rainfall led to near-average crop biomass. However, the Grand South regions experienced poor crop growth despite the late rainfall, necessitating food aid for 2 million people.

3. **May 2022**: Continued improvement in the north and central regions with an expected near to slightly below-average rice harvest. Poor crop production continued in the Grand Sud due to early season drought and flood damage. 1.7 million people remained in need of food assistance.

4. **June 2022**: The rice harvest finished with production slightly below average. The third consecutive drought in the Grand Sud and additional flood impacts increased food aid requirements for 1.6 million people.

5. **July 2022**: Estimated rice harvest was 6% below the previous year. Poor crop and livestock production persisted in the south, with continued food assistance needs for 1.6 million people.

6. **August 2022**: Off-season status. Approximately 1.7 million people required food assistance, predominantly in the Grand Sud and Grand Sud Est, due to recurrent droughts and earlier storm damage.

Despite some improvements in the central and northern regions earlier in the year, the recurring droughts and economic challenges in the southern regions have resulted in ongoing food insecurity, with severe outcomes anticipated as the lean season approaches in December.";Severe food insecurity anticipated in southern regions as lean season nears.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

Despite some improvement in agricultural conditions thanks to recent rainfall, about 1.5 million people still require food assistance. In detail:

- **Rice Production**: Prospects are mixed. The northwest regions (Boeny, Betsiboka, Sofia) are experiencing below-average crop biomass since December, whereas the central highlands (Vakinankaratra, Itasy, Alaotra Mangoro) have close to average conditions.

- **Grand South Agriculture**: After receiving well-above-average rainfall in December-January, the southwest (Atsimo Andrefana) displays above-average crop biomass. However, regions like Anosy and Androy have only close to average biomass due to irregular rainfall by the end of February.

- **Impact of Tropical Storms**: Two storms, Cheneso and Freddy, hit Madagascar early in the year, causing damage to infrastructure but likely limited cropland damage.

**Present Situation:** 
As of January 2020, the central and northern main producing provinces of Mozambique, including Sofala and Tete, have received beneficial rains which supported crop growth early in the season. Nonetheless, heavy rainfall commenced in January, resulting in flooding and crop damage across central and northern provinces such as Zambezia and Cabo Delgado. Roughly 2,300 hectares in Zambezia and 4,000 hectares in Cabo Delgado are currently flooded. Sofala, previously impacted by Cyclone Idai, is also suffering from flash and riverine floods.

**Context from Recent Months:** 
- **July 2019:** The 2018/19 agricultural season was marked by poor irregular rains in the south and by cyclones in central and northern provinces, resulting in a significant decline in cereal production and impacting food availability.
- **August 2019:** The main agricultural season ended poorly, predicting a negative effect on food security.
- **September & October 2019:** Mozambique was not labeled as a hotspot for food security concerns.
- **November 2019:** The southern provinces saw a significant reduction in rainfall, delaying the sowing season, although above-average rainfall was later received in central and southern regions. Severe drought-affected areas necessitated urgent agricultural input support for poor households.

**Overall Assessment:** 
While recent rains have been supportive, the mixed impact of persistent flooding and regional drought conditions continues to pose challenges to Mozambique's agricultural sector.

#### Current Situation:
- **Northern Provinces**: Nampula and Cabo Delgado are experiencing significant rainfall deficits since November, with cumulative amounts being 60-65% below average. This has led to a greenness anomaly affecting 40-50% of active cropland and rangeland. Zambezia is also facing poor crop conditions due to low rainfall.
- **Central and Southern Provinces**: These areas have received good rainfall, resulting in above-average crop and rangeland conditions.

#### Recent Developments:
- **Tropical Storm Eloise**: Made landfall on January 23rd in Sofala province, causing widespread flooding affecting 176,475 people and flooding over 142,000 ha of croplands, impacting Sofala, south of Manica, north of Inhambane, and eastern Gaza.
- **Humanitarian Crisis**: The crisis in the northern provinces (Cabo Delgado, Niassa, Nampula) is worsening due to growing insecurity, leading to nearly 530,000 displaced people and significant disruptions in livelihoods.

#### Contextual Background:
- **July 2020**: The main cereal season ended with a forecasted output of 3.0 million tons, about 10% above the 5-year average. However, southern provinces faced rainfall deficits, and Cabo Delgado was dealing with insecurity with 310,000 severely food insecure people.
- **October 2020**: The forecast indicated a high likelihood of average to above-average rainfall in central and southern Mozambique, potentially benefiting drought-affected areas. However, Cabo Delgadoâs insurgency increased the number of IDPs to 424,000.
- **November 2020**: Sowing of cereal crops began with favorable rainfall predictions for central and southern regions. However, below-average crop conditions in Zambezia and escalating violence in Cabo Delgado (over 710,000 people facing severe hunger) highlighted growing food insecurity.

Overall, while the central and southern regions show promising crop conditions due to adequate rainfall, the northern provinces are experiencing drought and security issues, leading to severe food insecurity and humanitarian crises.";Rainfall deficit worsens crop conditions in northern regions, security issues escalate.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/IBTSELOISE02.pdf; https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/unfpa_mozambique_fact_sheet_-_nothern_province_humanitarian_crisis_jan2021_0.pdf; https://allafrica.com/stories/202101180134.html; https://erccportal.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ECHO-Flash/ECHO-Flash-List/yy/2021/mm/1";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

Since November, these conditions have led to poor crop and rangeland conditions in provinces like Nampula, Niassa, Cabo Delgado, and Tete. Specifically, the northern provinces have experienced 65%-80% below-average rainfall, affecting 85%-95% of active crop areas.

In contrast, the southern part of the country has fared better, with above-average crop and rangeland conditions due to near-normal rainfall. However, the situation turned adverse with the arrival of Tropical Storm Ana in January 2022, flooding 37,930 hectares of crops primarily in central and northern regions, exacerbating food security concerns. 

Earlier in the year, climatic shocks were already impacting crop production, with around 8.2% of the total planted area affected. The persistent conflict in Cabo Delgado continues to be the main driver of food insecurity throughout this period. While the situation in the central provinces (Zambezia and Tete) was mixed, with periods of both good and poor rainfall, the overall crop and rangeland conditions are poor.

**Current Situation:**
As of mid-March 2024, Mozambique is experiencing significant drought conditions, especially in the central and southern regions. Cumulative rainfall over the last 90 days has been poor, with amounts varying between 25%-40% below the historical average. This has resulted in below-average crop conditions, particularly in Tete, Zambezia, northern Manica, and northern Sofala where water requirements for crops have not been met. Additionally, above-average temperatures since the beginning of February have exacerbated the situation, leading to further deterioration of crop conditions.

**Context from Previous Months:**
- From November 2023 onwards, rainfall has been sporadic with localized deficits. Despite good initial rains in October, regions such as Gaza, Inhambane, Manica, and Sofala experienced below-average rainfall.
- By January 2024, central and coastal areas continued to receive below-average rainfall, impacting crop conditions particularly in Tete and Zambezia.
- February 2024 was marked by continued poor rainfall, significantly affecting cereal-producing regions like Zambezia and Tete, with a delayed start to seasonal rains raising concerns about crop yield potentials.
- In March 2024, the adverse weather continued along with above-average temperatures. Tropical storm FILIPO and subsequent flooding added to the agricultural challenges.

**Northern Provinces & Security Situation:**
- The northern provinces have seen relatively better weather conditions for crop development, but insecurity in Cabo Delgado due to recent NSAG attacks and flooding have severely impacted agricultural activities.
- Displacement has increased significantly, with over 112,000 people displaced since late December due to ongoing violence.

**Impacts of Tropical Storm Filipo:**
- The storm affected over 57,000 people and significantly damaged crops, especially in Gaza, Inhambane, Maputo, and Sofala provinces, further straining the agricultural scenario.

**Future Outlook:**
- The forecast for April 2024 indicates below-average rainfall for central and southern regions, suggesting continued drought and challenging conditions for agriculture in these areas.";Severe drought amidst poor rainfall, impacting crop yields in southern regions.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://fews.net/southern-africa/mozambique/food-security-outlook/february-2024; https://mozambique.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl1106/files/documents/2024-03/iom-sitrep-filipo-northern-attacks_rev7.pdf; https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/mozambique-displacement-northern-cabo-delgado-situation-report-no-1-15-march-2024; https://erccportal.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ECHO-Products/Echo-Flash#/echo-flash-items?pageIndex=1&pageSize=10&st=Published&c=MOZ; https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/mozambique-maputo-heavy-rains-and-tropical-storm-filipo-flash-update-no-3-28-march-2024; https://fews.net/southern-africa/mozambique/key-message-update/march-2024; https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/seasonal_forecast.php?sfreg=africa";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

As of March 2023, Malawi's crop and rangeland conditions are reported to be average to above-average, largely due to good rainfall received over the last three months. However, the country has faced significant challenges that may impact overall agricultural productivity. 

**Contextualizing the Recent Past:**
- **October to November 2022:** Land preparation for the 2022/23 cereal cropping season began with a mixed forecast; northern Malawi expected below-average rainfall, while the southern part was forecasted to receive average rainfall.
- **January 2023:** After some early deficits, rainfall became average to above-average across all provinces, aiding crop development. Nonetheless, high prices of agricultural inputs and a reduction in subsidized fertilizer were anticipated to adversely affect crop yields.
- **February 2023:** Despite beneficial rain improving crop conditions, heavy rainfall caused flooding, particularly in Blantyre City, and the country faced its worst cholera outbreak on record.

**Current Situation (March 2023):**
The latest data suggest that although crops and rangelands are in good condition due to favorable rainfall, there are several pressing issues:
- Expected maize production is slightly below last year's levels and the five-year average.
- Tropical Cyclone Freddy induced severe flooding in mid-March, displacing over 563,000 people and damaging or washing away approximately 34,517 hectares of cropland.
- Impact from reduced fertilizer access and flood-induced damage may lead to lower-than-expected agricultural production, pending further assessments.

Overall, while the rainfall has benefited crop conditions, ongoing challenges such as flood damage and limited access to agricultural inputs present significant risks to Malawi's agricultural output for the current season.";Cyclone, floods, fertilizer struggles threaten agricultural yields despite favorable rainfall.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://fews.net/southern-africa/malawi/key-message-update/january-2023; https://reliefweb.int/report/malawi/malawi-tropical-cyclone-freddy-department-disaster-management-affairs-dodma-situation-report-no-8-21-22-march-2023; https://fews.net/southern-africa/malawi/key-message-update/january-2023";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

**Current Situation:** As of mid-January, cumulative rainfall has been average to above-average, aiding farming activities and pasture availability. However, earlier conditions between early November and mid-December were quite adverse, with rainfall 55% below-average and above-average temperatures in Central and Southern regions, resulting in below-average crop conditions affecting 40%-45% of the active crop area. In contrast, the Northern region has seen close to average crop conditions due to receiving adequate rainfall.

**Economic Impact:** The economic environment in Malawi is deteriorating, marked by high inflation and a shortage of foreign exchange. Households are struggling to access food and basic non-food commodities. Fertilizer prices have surged by 20%-40%, hindering preparations for the 2023/24 agricultural season and potentially compromising future production.

**Future Outlook:** Heavy rainfall has led to significant flooding, causing casualties and damage.

The persistent and significant rainfall deficits throughout the 2018/2019 agricultural season, combined with above-average temperatures, have created dire circumstances for both crop and pastoral areas across the country. 

Crop growing regions, such as Omusati, Oshikoto, and Ohangwena, received only 30-45% of average rainfall from November 2018 to April 2019, resulting in notably diminished cereal production. Overall cereal production is estimated to be around 71,400 tons for the season, marking a drastic 53% decline from the previous season. For various cereals like maize in Zambezi, Kavango West and Kavango East, millet, and sorghum, production is expected to drop by 78%, 68%, and 86% respectively below average levels.

Pastoral regions experienced similar hardship, with regions such as Hardap and Kunene receiving only 15% of average cumulative rainfall, and Otjozondjupa, Omaheke, and Khomas obtaining just 25-30%. Rangeland conditions in the north-western, western, and southern parts of the country are especially poor, continuing a trend of drought from the previous season. These conditions have led to below-average biomass productivity and substantial livestock mortality, with over 63,700 animal deaths reported due to inadequate grazing conditions.

As of January 2021, Namibia's agricultural sector faces multiple challenges. The pastoral areas in the northeastern regions, especially Kunene, Omusati, and Erongo, are experiencing poor biomass conditions. These regions have significant portions of their rangeland area affected by greenness anomalies, indicating below-average pasture growth despite some good rainfall at the end of December and beginning of January. However, cumulative rainfall since the start of the season remains below average.

**Notable Issues:**
1. **Rangelands:** Kunene has about 85% of its rangeland area affected, Omusati about 50%, and Erongo approximately 45%.
2. **Crop Conditions:** Omusati is showing below-average crop conditions, with a reduction in vegetation activity.
3. **Locust Invasion:** The African migratory locust has damaged 50,000 hectares of croplands in the Zambezi region.
4. **Flooding:** Heavy rainfall in January has led to flooding and flash floods in central and southern regions, particularly affecting Khomas and Karas, with the Fish River banks bursting in Karas.

The country had previously seen beneficial conditions for cereal production, with significant harvests in mid-2020. However, recent months have shown a shift to more adverse conditions, especially impacting rangelands and crop areas.

Despite an above-average total cereal production in mid-2023, largely thanks to the commercial sector, drought conditions have intensified.

Throughout the latter part of 2023, Namibia has not been classified as a hotspot by drought monitoring systems, but the situation has deteriorated significantly since then. By November 2023, delays in sowing activities and adverse greenness anomalies were reported across several northern provinces, affecting crop and pasture conditions.

In January 2024, critical pastoral areas, particularly in Omaheke, Otjozondjupa, and Khomas, show poor biomass conditions with significant rainfall deficits since the season's start, affecting 35%-65% of active rangeland. Though northern cropping areas received close to average rainfall, some regions such as Zambezi and Kavango West experienced severe deficits, leading to poor crop conditions in these areas, with 35%-40% of active crop area affected by greenness anomalies.

#### Current Situation:
- **Rainfall and Greenness:**
  - Although there has been favorable rainfall since the season's start, below-average crop conditions are present in the regions of Dosso, Tahoua, and Diffa, where 30%-60% of active crop areas are affected by greenness anomalies.
  - Similarly, poor rangeland conditions are observed in most southern regions, with 30%-40% of active rangeland areas being affected by greenness anomalies.

- **Impact of Insecurity:**
  - Persistent insecurity in the regions of TillabÃ©ri, Tahoua, Diffa, and Maradi is limiting engagement in agricultural activities, potentially causing localized production deficits.
  - The political crisis and resulting sanctions are expected to worsen food insecurity by reducing supply and increasing prices of imported cereals and food commodities due to trade suspensions with Nigeria and Benin. 

#### Recent Past Context:
- **Land Preparation and Planting:**
  - Mid-June saw the start of land preparation and planting of sorghum and millet crops with the arrival of the first seasonal rains.
  - By July, planting continued under average conditions, although a 10-day rainfall deficit had minor effects in Dosso, TillabÃ©ri, Maradi, and Zinder.

- **Rangeland and Livestock:**
  - Improvement in vegetation cover noted in July as a result of rains, though access to high grazing potential areas remains restricted due to insecurity.
  - A concentration of livestock in relatively secure areas is occurring, but continued cattle thefts, particularly along the borders with Mali and Burkina Faso, pose significant challenges.

- **Forecasts:**
  - The Copernicus C3S Multimodel forecast indicated a slight favor towards above-average rainfall for July-August and now August 2023.

#### Food Insecurity and Crisis:
- Regions facing Crisis outcomes (IPC Phase 3) include TillabÃ©ri, Tahoua, Diffa, and Maradi.
- The political and security situation is exacerbating food insecurity, particularly affecting trade and livelihood activities.

Overall, although rains have been favorable, the ongoing insecurity and recent political crisis augment the complexity of agricultural and rangeland conditions, posing a threat to food security in Niger.";Favorable rains offset by insecurity and political crisis worsening food security.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://www.fao.org/giews/countrybrief/country.jsp?code=NER; https://reliefweb.int/report/niger/niger-preliminary-analysis-impacts-political-crisis-and-sanctions-food-security-and-markets-12-august-2023";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

As of July 2018, crop-related conditions in Nigeria appear to be showing signs of improvement despite earlier challenges. Initially, the country did not register as a hotspot for drought conditions. However, by April, the west, particularly Niger province, experienced a delayed start to the crop season due to insufficient rainfall. By May, early season maize crop conditions in southern and central regions were slightly below average, and security issues in the North East posed additional challenges for field preparation and planting.

June presented continued below-average rainfall in central and northern parts (notably in Niger and Kwara) with below-average crop conditions extending to some eastern areas. 

As of July, despite an initial delay in the rainy season, cumulative rainfall has improved and become generally favorable in water-limited regions. Nonetheless, conflict in the North East persists, significantly affecting agricultural and pastoral activities, especially hindering pastoral mobility with many pastoralists remaining in central and southern areas instead of migrating back north. These conditions need ongoing monitoring to ensure effective agricultural progress.";Improving rainfall benefits crops, but conflict hampers agricultural activities in north.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

First season crops are generally in good condition across the country. However, intense rainfall and flooding in August and September, especially along the Niger and Benue rivers, have caused significant damage to farmlands and crop losses. Jigawa state has been particularly affected, with 46,000 farmers losing farmland to floodwaters. The flooding has also disrupted main transportation routes, possibly restricting food access in rural areas.

The ongoing conflict in northeastern Nigeria continues to impede both agricultural activities and pastoral movements, contributing to food insecurity for more than 2 million people.

In August 2022, Nigeria's agricultural landscape presents a mixed situation. The southern bimodal areas are harvesting main-season maize with favorable production prospects due to timely rains and generally average precipitation. However, the northern regions, preparing for the harvest of coarse grains in September, face significant challenges. Vegetation anomalies persist in the northeast, primarily due to restricted agricultural activities from ongoing conflicts and insecurity.

Heavy rainfall in August exacerbated the situation, causing flooding, loss of lives, and destruction of homes, infrastructure, and farmlands in Jigawa and Adamawa states. Flooding incidents also threaten the rice fields in Niger state, with around 2,000 hectares at risk of being submerged.

Humanitarian needs are critical, with approximately 19.45 million people projected to require food assistance between June and August 2022. This includes 1.18 million in an emergency state, driven by deteriorated security conditions, conflicts, localized food production shortfalls, high food prices, and reduced incomes.

The hurricanes affected 3 million people across 56 municipalities, damaging infrastructures and farmlands, primarily in the north and the Caribbean areas. Preliminary estimates indicate severe losses for bean and maize crops, with beans experiencing up to 70% losses and maize up to 60% in the most affected areas. While the final impact on postrera production is not yet officially documented, the immediate outlook is concerning.

This comes after a period of generally favorable crop conditions earlier in the year. From June to October 2020, Nicaragua experienced mostly good rains, supporting satisfactory vegetation conditions and crop development for both the primera and postrera seasons.

The country experienced a mix of excessive rainfall in early October, primarily caused by hurricane Julia, which led to flash floods and significant infrastructure damage, and mostly dry conditions in the latter part of the month. Most cropland (88%) saw normal rainfall accumulation, but 12% experienced below-normal rainfall.

Temperatures remained normal throughout the month, and the water supply for crops was largely balanced, although some regions suffered from excessive water or drought conditions. The vegetation index shows varying conditions: normal in 57% of croplands, above average in 33%, and below average in 10%, especially affected were regions such as AtlÃ¡ntico Norte, Jinotega, Matagalpa, AtlÃ¡ntico Sur, and Chinandega.

Economic factors continue to pose challenges. Headline inflation is high at 11%, and food price inflation is at 17%, reducing households' purchasing power and food access. Moreover, while some crops like sorghum and beans (main) have been successfully harvested, the combination of dry spells and excessive rains in October poses a threat to crop growth and yields. Food security has deteriorated despite ongoing harvests due to the high food prices and recent hurricane impacts. 

Natural disasters have compounded these issues, with hurricane Julia in October and hurricane Fiona in September causing extensive damage and displacing thousands of households. The government's economic loss estimates from these events are substantial, ranging between $160-$200 million, which is about 1.5% of national GDP.

As of May 2019, the country is facing emerging crop-related drought conditions. Over the past month, three key provinces in the rice bowl area received only half of their normal rainfall, negatively impacting early crops like potato, wheat, and barley. Additionally, there was a lack of snow cover during the winter, leaving winter crops unprotected from cold temperatures, further affecting wheat and barley. Satellite imagery indicates a reduction in flooded rice fields compared to the previous year, raising concerns about either a decrease in irrigated rice areas or delayed planting. While it's early to definitively conclude reduced 2019 production, combined factors such as recent rainfall deficits, poor early crop prospects, and the subpar harvest in 2018 have put the country's food security in a critical situation, as highlighted by the FAO/WFP.";Emerging drought, poor rainfall, and harsh winter threaten critical crop yields.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;http://www.fao.org/3/ca4447en/CA4447EN.pdf;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

Despite the good main harvests of millet and sorghum, which benefited from generally favorable agro-climatic conditions and average to above-average rains throughout the growing season, the country is grappling with substantial macroeconomic stresses and political tensions. Heavy rains and flooding in August and September caused considerable damage to crops and infrastructure, affecting hundreds of thousands of people across numerous states. These environmental challenges were compounded by fuel shortages, high prices of agricultural inputs, and wider economic issues stemming from political instability and inflation.

Emergency food assistance remains critically high, exceeding the need for the past five-year average. The situation is exacerbated by political unrest, a limited supply of wheat flour, and reduced household purchasing power.

There's also an initial delay in planting visible in key irrigated areas. Adequate rainfall in August will be crucial to improving crop conditions, especially in rain-fed regions.

The country remains deeply affected by a prolonged political crisis and poor macro-economic conditions, further exacerbated by intercommunal clashes and high levels of insecurity. Even with the finalized winter wheat harvest in April, yields were below average in the northeast due to dry conditions and ongoing socio-economic difficulties.

**July 2019**: Senegal is experiencing significant delays in the onset of the rainy season, especially in its central and northern agricultural regions, where a one-month delay has postponed planting activities. Although planting in the southern part commenced in June, the crop areas and growth are simultaneously suffering from substantial rainfall deficits of 30-50%. The below-average seasonal rainfall forecast for June to September heightens the risk of low crop production across the country. Immediate rainfall improvements are critical for the regions to mitigate the impacts of these deficits and support agricultural activities.

In October 2022, the country experienced a mix of favorable and challenging conditions for agricultural activities. The maize (main) harvest was ongoing, with other crops like rice, beans, and sorghum in advanced growth stages. Rainfall patterns were inconsistent, with below-normal accumulation in the first and third dekads, but excessive rainfall during the second dekad. Water requirements for crops were well met, with above-average water availability in 69% of cropland.

However, recent economic constraints and high input costs have led to forecasted reductions in crop production, particularly for rice, maize, and sorghum. Adding to these challenges, three hurricanes (Julia, Lisa, and Fiona) caused significant damage, including extreme floods, landslides, and infrastructure destruction, adversely impacting bean crops with an estimated 18% loss.

Food security remains a concern with continued high food prices and elevated inflation diminishing household purchasing power. While the start of the harvest season may provide some relief, overall conditions highlight ongoing vulnerabilities in the agricultural sector and food security.

### Context from Previous Months

- **April**: Favorable weather conditions supported rice harvest and land preparation. Economic shocks included rising food prices and fertilizer costs due to global events.
- **May**: Normal to above-average rainfall aided sowing of main staple crops. Food prices continued to rise, exacerbating lean season challenges.
- **June**: Unfavorable early weather improved by mid-month, aiding crop sowing. Food security worsened with price increases and high inflation.
- **July**: Rainfall was below normal, particularly affecting early crop growth. Economic conditions, high food prices, and inflation further stressed food security.
- **August**: Mostly normal to above-negative rainfall supported crop growth, yet production forecasts remained low due to economic factors. High prices of inputs continued to constrain farming activities.
- **September**: Not identified as a hotspot for crop stress.

Overall, while agricultural conditions improved slightly in August, the cumulative effect of economic challenges and natural disasters has impacted crop yields and food security, culminating in significant difficulties in October.";"Hurricanes and high costs slash maize, rice, sorghum yields; prices surge.";the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://www.fao.org/giews/countrybrief/country.jsp?lang=en&code=SLV; https://climate.copernicus.eu/charts/c3s_seasonal/c3s_seasonal_spatial_mm_rain_3m?facets=Parameters,precipitation&time=2022080100,744,2022090100&type=ensm&area=area13; https://floodlist.com/america/central-america-hurricane-julia-october-2022; https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2022-000357-blz; https://floodlist.com/america/floods-el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-nicaragua-september-2022; https://www.proteccioncivil.gob.sv/2022/10/09/comunicado-en-el-marco-del-estado-de-emergencia-nacional-por-el-huracan-julia-09-octubre-2022/; https://diarioelsalvador.com/autoridades-han-atendido-mas-de-3200-emergencias-por-la-tormenta-julia/283393/; https://www.laprensagrafica.com/economia/Lluvias-danaron-un-18--del-frijol-segun-CAMPO-20221012-0015.html; https://latinarepublic.com/2022/10/13/hurricane-julia-hits-central-american-countries-as-tropical-storm/; https://reliefweb.int/report/el-salvador/el-salvador-boletin-de-precios-octubre-2022";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

As of November 2023, Somalia is experiencing significant challenges related to exceptional rains and associated widespread flooding, particularly in Southern Somalia's Shabelle and Juba river basins. These heavy rains, occurring from mid-October to mid-November, have led to loss of life and major damage to urban and rural infrastructure. Flooded urban areas are notably visible in Beletweyne and Luuq. The weather forecasts indicate a high likelihood of continued above-average rainfall through December and January, potentially exacerbating flood conditions.

In terms of agricultural impact, the Gu season harvests in most parts of Somalia have been below average due to insufficient and short seasonal rainfall compounded by high temperatures. Assessments show a 34% reduction in cereal production from the long-term average in Southern Somalia, contributing to the high levels of acute food insecurity.

Food security remains dire, with 4.3 million people classified in IPC Phase 3 or above (Crisis or worse) for the period between October and December 2023. Specifically, 3.3 million are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 1 million in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). Additionally, 5.9 million people are in stress (IPC Phase 2). These acute food insecurity levels are driven by the adverse impacts of El NiÃ±o rains and funding constraints for humanitarian assistance.

Overall, the situation highlights an ongoing need for sustained and coordinated humanitarian efforts to address both immediate needs and longer-term recovery, particularly given the compounded effects of severe weather events and protracted crises.";Exceptional rains cause floods, exacerbate acute food insecurity conditions further.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/s/057b1b19; https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/s/69a20a71; https://fsnau.org/downloads/Somalia-IPC-Acute-Food-Insecurity-Malnutrition-Report-Aug-Dec-2023.pdf";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

**Current Situation:** As of May 2021, agro-climatic conditions in South Sudan show some improvements, particularly in Central and Western Equatoria where vegetation conditions have recovered due to positive rains. The start of the rainy season in central and northern unimodal areas also began on time with above-average rainfall in Upper Nile, Jonglei, and Unity regions.

**Contextual Background:** 
1. **November 2020:** The country experienced severe flooding, particularly in Jonglei and areas along the White Nile since late 2019, leading to destruction of crops, food stocks, and loss of livestock. Food insecurity was pushed to emergency levels due to flooding, conflict, and an economic crisis.
2. **January to March 2021:** While the season ended with above-average rains beneficial to crops and pasture, food production remains below pre-conflict levels. February and March saw continued high food insecurity levels, attributed to prolonged conflict, economic challenges, and the impact of COVID-19. Some regions noted delayed planting seasons coupled with high temperatures and varying rainfall patterns.
3. **April 2021:** Despite high temperatures and dry conditions initially affecting some regions, forecasts indicated likely improvement with the onset of expected average to above-average rains. However, concerns persisted regarding conflict, economic downturns, and flood impacts that complicate access to agricultural inputs and humanitarian aid.

**Impact:** The cumulative effects of prolonged conflict, economic downturns, recurrent flooding, and the COVID-19 pandemic have led to alarming levels of food insecurity. Over 7.24 million South Sudanese, equating to 60% of the population, are expected to face acute food insecurity during the lean season (April to July 2021), marking the highest levels since independence.";Improved rains benefit crops, yet flood impacts and conflict strain food security.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;https://www.icpac.net/fsnwg/;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

In October 2023, Uganda is experiencing generally below-average vegetation conditions in central and northern regions due to irregular rainfall and above-average temperatures in September and early October. Though there has been improved rainfall in the second dekad of October, it remains uncertain if the positive rainfall forecasts for November by ICPAC and Copernicus C3S Multimodel will still be beneficial for the crops at this late stage of the season.

**Contextual Overview (Previous Months):**

- **April 2023:** Favorable vegetation conditions and abundant rainfall in March improved crop prospects, though acute food insecurity persisted in the Karamoja subregion.
  
- **May 2023:** Continued favorable vegetation conditions supported crop and pasture growth, albeit high food insecurity remained in Karamoja.

- **June 2023:** Below-average rainfall in early June was offset by improved rainfall in mid-June, aiding crop growth. IPC estimates indicated 582,000 people faced high food insecurity, with 102,000 in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).

- **July 2023:** Average cereal crop harvest expected, though vegetation in western and central Uganda began to decline.

- **August 2023:** Despite good first season crop conditions, pastoral vegetation deteriorated due to a hot, dry month. IPC estimates remained high with 582,000 people in IPC Phase 3 or above.

- **September 2023:** Erratic rainfall marked the onset of the second season, impacting early crop development. However, there was a decrease in high food insecurity projections compared to the previous period.

In Al Hudaydah, rainfall has been above average from July to September, which bodes well for crops. However, despite these positive weather conditions, the ongoing conflict and lack of farming inputs are anticipated to result in lower cereal production compared to both pre-conflict levels and the previous year (2018).

Contextually, the past six months saw various challenges: March and April experienced below-average rainfall, impacting the onset of the rainy season and crop planting. May continued to see insufficient rainfall, raising concerns about potential crop growth. The situation slightly improved in June with above-average rains, though this also caused flash floods affecting thousands in multiple regions. By July and August, Yemen was not considered a hotspot for agricultural distress, indicating some stabilization.

Currently, the country is facing severe crop and rangeland challenges predominantly in the Southern, Central, and Western regions due to a delayed onset of rainfall and a prolonged dry spell since late February. These regions, which contribute significantly to maize production, have experienced drastically low rainfall (8%, 45%, and 17% of the average 30-day cumulative rainfall, respectively), leading to crop damage beyond recovery. Additionally, approximately 200,000 hectares of maize fields have been adversely affected by fall armyworm. Southern Zambia reports widespread crop failure caused by an extended dry spell in early March.

In contrast, northern parts of the country have had favorable weather conditions throughout the season, resulting in near-average vegetation conditions. As a whole, national maize production is projected to remain below the average level of 3 million tonnes. Thus, while the north fares better, the south is grappling with severe agricultural setbacks.";"Severe drought and pests decimate maize crops; national production drops significantly.";the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/files/special_focus_2019_03.pdf;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

**Current Situation:**  
The country is facing severe weather conditions impacting food security. Most parts have experienced significant shortfalls in rainfall and higher-than-average temperatures since November, leading to dry crop and rangeland conditions primarily in the Southern, Western, and Central provinces. Recent heavy rains in January caused flash and riverine flooding, severely affecting districts in the south (Gwembe and Siavonga) and east (Mambwe and Lumezi). This flooding destroyed crops, particularly in Gwembe Districtâs Munyumbwe area.

**Contextual Background:**
- **July 2019:** A 15% decrease in cereal output compared to the previous year, and 30% below the 5-year average, due to drought affecting southern and western regions.
- **August 2019:** Poor performance of the main agricultural season, affecting food security. Low dam water levels impacted winter wheat irrigation.
- **September & October 2019:** A modest improvement in winter wheat harvests, but still 23% below the 5-year average. Initial planting activities began, with forecasts predicting average to above-average rainfall.
- **November 2019:** Rainfall deficit and high temperatures continued to stress crops and rangelands. Average to slightly above-average rainfall in mid-November offered some relief but sustained rainfall is needed. Critical water resources, like Kariba Dam, were at critically low levels.

**Conclusion:**  
The country endures a challenging period with alternating extreme droughts and floods. Droughts have significantly reduced agricultural productivity and water resources, while recent floods exacerbated crop damage. This sequence has led to heightened food insecurity, particularly in the Southern province. Close monitoring and sustained intervention are essential for stabilizing the situation.";Severe drought and floods devastate crops, exacerbating food insecurity nationwide.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ROSEA_20200116_ZambiaFloods_FlashUpdate%231_def%20%281%29.pdf;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

In January 2022, the country is experiencing significant drought and crop stress conditions, particularly in the Eastern and Northern provinces. Below-average rainfall in November and December, combined with above-average temperatures, has led to dry crop and rangeland conditions. The Eastern province is notably affected, with 80%-90% of active crop and rangeland area showing signs of stress. In the Northern province, 68% of the rangeland area is similarly affected. Other provinces, such as Lusaka and Central, are facing moderate impacts, with 40%-45% of active crop area affected.

However, good rains in early January have somewhat alleviated these deficits and improved vegetation conditions. Despite this, the forecast for February and March suggests drier than normal conditions, which could further impact cereal grain development.

Adding to the complexity, heavy rainfall in January caused flooding in the Southern province, submerging 5,000-8,000 hectares of crops in the Namwala district and leading to casualties and damage. This varied and extreme weather highlights ongoing challenges for agriculture in the country.";Drought, crop stress, and flooding disrupt agriculture across Eastern provinces.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://floodlist.com/africa/zambia-floods-southern-province-january-2022; https://erccportal.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ECHO-Products/Echo-Flash; https://reliefweb.int/report/zambia/zambia-namwala-flash-floods-emergency-plan-action-epoa-dref-operation-n-mdrzm015";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

Zambia's recent months have seen varying conditions affecting crop and rangeland health. Initially, there were positive outcomes in maize production, with a 21% increase from the previous year. Throughout August and September, Zambia was not identified as a hotspot for crop-related issues.

However, since October, the country has been experiencing a pattern of below-average rainfall, which was predicted by seasonal forecasts. This situation persisted through November with a notable rainfall deficit, particularly hitting Southern and Lusaka provinces, coupled with above-average temperatures in the southwestern region.

By January 2024, the eastern and central parts of Zambia have faced significant below-average rainfall and above-average temperatures from November to mid-December. This has led to dry crop and rangeland conditions, especially impacting Southern, Central, and Eastern provinces, areas crucial for the majority of the nation's cereal production. Despite miglioramenti observed due to good rains in the last month, water-stressed vegetation conditions remain prevalent across southern regions, whereas northern areas exhibit healthy vegetation. Future forecasts continue to predict below-average rainfall across most of the country, with the exception of the northernmost regions.";Below-average rainfall and high temperatures threaten critical crop regions, 2024.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/country.php?cntry=270; https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/seasonal_forecast.php?sfreg=africa";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

Rainfall between end of January and mid-March has been significantly below average (40%-70% below the historical average), coupled with high temperatures. This situation severely affects the Southern, Central, and Eastern provinces, key areas contributing to approximately 60% of the nationâs cereal production. Around 45%-65% of the active crop area in these provinces exhibits a greenness anomaly, signaling stressed vegetation, with rangeland conditions similarly poor.

The immediate past months show a progression of deteriorating conditions:
- November 2023: Notable rainfall deficits began in the southern parts of the country.
- January 2024: Crop and rangeland conditions worsened due to continuing dry spells and high temperatures, despite some localized rainfalls.
- February 2024: The rainfall deficiencies persisted across major producing provinces, resulting in significantly below-average biomass conditions. A dry spell combined with high temperatures led to a national disaster being declared.
  
Most recently, the drought has destroyed about 1 million hectares of maize, with significant adverse impacts on food security both domestically and regionally. The government has declared a national emergency due to the drought affecting 84 out of 116 districts, with devastating effects on agriculture and pastoral lands.

Earlier months saw a consistent trend of rainfall deficits, particularly in the southern and central regions, adversely affecting crop and rangeland conditions. Despite some above-average rainfall in the northeastern parts, helping mitigate moisture stress, the southern areas did not receive adequate rainfall. These deficits led to permanent wilting of crops and necessitated replanting efforts, which was further hampered by economic challenges and high inflation impacting farmers' access to inputs and market prices.

In late February and continuing into March, the western regions experienced almost no rainfall, further intensifying drought conditions.

As of January 2020, Zimbabwe is facing its worst hunger crisis in a decade, with 7.7 million people experiencing severe food insecurity and only enough grain reserves to last just over a month. The countryâs economic difficulties, compounded by extreme weather conditions, have severely impacted agricultural productivity. Poor precipitation in December and limited rainfall resumption in January have led to below-average crop conditions and significant livestock fatalities.

In the preceding months (July 2019 - November 2019), Zimbabwe saw a decline in cereal and wheat production due to adverse weather, Cyclone Idai's destruction, and economic constraints such as high inflation and shortages of agricultural inputs. These issues culminated in substantial wheat output reductions and exacerbated food security challenges.

Furthermore, livestock conditions deteriorated considerably due to poor pasture availability and water scarcity, leading to a marked increase in livestock deaths. Heavy rains in November provided some relief for pastures but were accompanied by severe storms causing infrastructure damages.

Thus, combined adverse weather patterns and a volatile economic environment have steadily worsened Zimbabweâs food insecurity and agricultural challenges over the past six months.";Worst hunger crisis in a decade: 7.7 million face severe food insecurity.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Tackling%20Southern%20Africa%E2%80%99s%20Climate-Driven%20Food%20Crisis%20Update%20%233%2C%2014%20January%202020.pdf; https://www.reuters.com/article/zimbabwe-grains/zimbabwe-says-grain-stocks-running-out-after-drought-idUSL8N29S3S1; https://fews.net/southern-africa/zimbabwe/food-security-outlook-update/december-2019";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

As of March 2022, the country has experienced fluctuating rainfall patterns over the past few months which have affected crop conditions diversely. Heavy rains in January benefited crop and rangeland conditions initially, though it led to issues such as water logging and nitrogen deficiency in some areas. February saw below-average rainfall, but it barely impacted vegetation conditions. However, the first part of March continued with below-average rainfall, before improving in the middle of the month.

Despite recent precipitation improvements, remote sensing indicates persistent pockets of water-stressed vegetation, particularly in Mashonaland West, Central, East, and Manicaland provinces. Consequently, the national harvest outlook for 2022 is projected to be below average, with significant maize crop losses exceeding 50% in some of the eastern, southern, and western districts that were severely impacted by dry conditions earlier.";Fluctuating rainfall, water-stressed vegetation lead to below-average 2022 harvest outlook.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;https://fews.net/southern-africa/zimbabwe/key-message-update/march-2022;"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.

As of March 2024, Zimbabwe is experiencing severe and widespread drought conditions that have significantly impacted agricultural productivity. Below-average cumulative rainfall (70%-85% below the historical average) and high temperatures from January through mid-March have resulted in below-average crop and rangeland conditions across the country. 

**Context and Key Developments:**
- **Rainfall Forecast:** The seasonal rainfall forecast continues to predict below-average rainfall through April 2024, making recovery for crops unlikely.
- **Water Deficit:** Crops have not received adequate water to meet their needs, and soil moisture levels remain critically low.
- **Area Planted and Yield Prospects:** There has been a 6% decline in the total area planted for all crops compared to the previous season, with maize planting alone declining by 12%. These factors are expected to result in below-average yields for the 2024 cereal crops.
- **Livestock and Rangeland:** Approximately 89% of cropland and all rangeland in Matabeleland North are suffering from severe water deficits. The grazing resources and water availability for livestock are also deteriorating.
- **Economic Impact:** The Zimbabwean dollar has devalued significantly, contributing to increased prices for basic food and commodities.
- **National Disaster:** Zimbabwe has declared a national disaster due to the drought, with the president stating that the grain harvest will meet just over half of the nation's cereal needs for the season.

Overall, the compounded effects of delayed rain, prolonged dry spells, and high temperatures during critical crop development periods have culminated in a dire agricultural outlook for Zimbabwe, potentially exacerbating food security concerns.";Severe drought intensifies, crop yields plummet, Zimbabwe declares national disaster.;the JRC-ASAP system;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly;https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu;"https://reliefweb.int/report/zimbabwe/zimbabwe-food-security-and-markets-monitoring-report-february-2024; https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/seasonal_forecast.php?sfreg=africa; https://fews.net/southern-africa/zimbabwe/food-security-outlook/february-2024; https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/zimbabwean-president-declares-state-of-disaster-due-to-drought";"Access the data directly <a href=""https://data.humdata.org/dataset/asap-hotspots-monthly"">on HDX</a>.
